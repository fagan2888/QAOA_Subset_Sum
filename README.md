# QAOA_Subset_Sum
Solution of A Variation of the Subset-Sum Problem using Variational Quantum Algorithm (QAOA)

The article and the corresponding code are aimed at solving the subset-sum problem with a slight variation in the problem-statement using Quantum-Classical hybrid algorithms like QAOA [1]. A theoretical understanding of the Quantum Approximate Optmimization Algorithm is expected on the part of the reader.

The authors hope that this article will hold some tutorial value on solving the aforementioned problem using variational algorithms and implementing them from scratch using Qiskit [2]. Please refer to the file 'Subset_sum_Hybrid_solution.ipynb' for the code, and 'Solution_of_A_Variation_of_the_Subset-Sum_Problem_using_Variational_Quantum_Algorithms.pdf' for detailed explanation of the code.
